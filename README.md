# MicroClientLibrary
A project that bootstraps an Angular library that deploys both dev-time angular class libraries(components, services, etc) and run-time Angular element libraries.

---
## Quickstart

1.  Build the default library

    $ `npm run build:weja-library`

2.  Build the default library

    $ `npm run build:weja-elements`

3.  Open the index.html file found in the root of the project. If you get a message like the following:
---
<h2 style="background-color: mintcream; text-align: center">
    Your very own Angular custom web component says: Hello, world!
</h2>

---
...then congrats, you just built a static web component that you can proudly deploy anywhere and runs anywhere! 

Feel free to try [micro-realm](https://github.com/Micro-cosm/micro-realm) and just as quickly deploy to firebase and integrate to your enterprise GCP services.

# Try from scratch using Angular CLI
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5,  [README.scratch.md](./README.scratch.md) shares the steps to

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
